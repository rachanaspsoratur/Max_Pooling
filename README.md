# Max_Pooling
Make Sure you have necessary libraries installed. you can install them pip if you haven't already : pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn
The provided code defines two functions for performing max pooling on a matrix: max_pooling and improved_max_pooling.                                                         *The max_pooling function calculates the maximum value in each window of size k x k in the input matrix.                                                                       *The improved_max_pooling function optimizes this process by finding the maximum value in each row of the window without using the np.max function.
the code demonstrates how to use these functions by generating a random matrix and applying both max pooling algorithms to it.                                              1.Define a matrix for input data.                                                                                                                                            2.Choose a window size k.                                                                                                                                                      3.Call the max_pooling or improved_max_pooling function with the matrix and window size as arguments to perform the max pooling operation.                                    4.Print the output to see the results.
